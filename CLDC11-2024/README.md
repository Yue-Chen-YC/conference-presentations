## Abstract
This study delves into the impact of the Parallel Functioning Hypothesis on various aspects of sentence processing, including first fixation duration, number of fixations, and number of skips. Despite the extensive study of the Parallel Functioning Hypothesis in psycholinguistics, its influence on discourse-level processing and naturalistic reading remains largely unexplored. Thus, this research aims to bridge this gap by examining the relationship between the Parallel Functioning Hypothesis and reading behavior. The results indicate subtle disparities between sentences adhering to the Parallel Function and those that do not, as demonstrated in Table 1. Notably, the study uncovers that the linear distances between subject referents and pronouns, along with the grammatical positions of subjects and pronouns, significantly affect the duration of first fixations. Intrasentential sentences, where pronouns and their referents are in separate phrases, tend to elicit longer fixation durations on subject nouns and shorter durations on target pronouns compared to intersentential sentences. This suggests a heightened cognitive load associated with processing intrasentential structures. Furthermore, sentences employing subject-object structures exhibit prolonged fixation durations on the referent in the subject position and shorter fixation times on the pronoun in the object position. These findings shed light on the cognitive mechanisms involved in pronoun resolution, including mental processing times and heuristic strategies. They enrich our comprehension of eye fixation patterns during sentence processing across various functional and grammatical configurations. By examining the Parallel Function of pronouns and antecedents, this study provides deeper insights into the cognitive processes underlying the influence of salient referents on readers and their resolution of pronoun ambiguities. Overall, this research contributes to advancing our understanding of language processing mechanisms and their implications for cognitive psychology and linguistics.

**Table 1: Example of Parallel Function and Non-Parallel Function** 
| Pronoun Grammatical Function | Antecedent NP Grammatical Function| Sentence Label| Sentence Example  |
|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| Subject  | Subject | Parallel function | **Nathan** disliked Aron and similarly, **he** hated Nicole for a while and in the end, they all avoided each other |
| Subject  | Object   | Non-Parallel Function       |   **Fiona** defeated in the court and so James congratulated **her** after the match but nobody took any notice |
