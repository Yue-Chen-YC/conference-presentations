Disfluencies in natural speech often precede low-frequency words and occur in complex utterances. While previous research has shown that disfluencies influence language development and processing, the specific roles of child-produced and adult-produced disfluencies in naturalistic settings remain underexplored. This study analyzed 44 monolingual English-learning children over 1.25 years (age = 1;9–3;0) to examine disfluencies and language development in preschoolers during naturalistic adult-child play. Results indicate that both child- and parent-produced disfluencies significantly enhance children’s lexical development (e.g., verbs-per-utterance, parent disfluency: β=0.17, p<0.05; child disfluency: β=0.06, p<0.05), with their interaction amplifying verb production and overall vocabulary diversity. These effects vary developmentally, showing stronger impacts at certain age points. Moreover, the distribution of disfluency types differed between adults and children, highlighting their different roles in communicative functions. These findings provide novel evidence for the facilitative role of disfluencies in early vocabulary development, with important implications for understanding the mechanisms of language acquisition.
